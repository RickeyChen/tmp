We introduced Kafka as the message queue for the user activity function last week to replace the previous in-memory queue. However, when we promoted the Kafka topic to the production environment two months ago, the Kafka team indicated that the operation had been completed, but in fact the topic was not successfully pushed to the production environment (the same thing had happened in the UAT environment before). As a result, our preintercepter returned false abnormally when sending messages to Kafka, which further led to the requests being unable to actually enter the cache method. Consequently, all scenarios directly called ACE to regenerate cache files.
