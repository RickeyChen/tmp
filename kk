**Subject:** Update on Tomcat 9 to 10 Upgrade  

Dear [Recipient's Name],  

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the upgrade from Tomcat 9 to Tomcat 10. At the moment, we are unable to proceed with the Tomcat 10 upgrade because it requires Java 17 or higher, and we are currently in the process of a significant effort to upgrade our JDK from version 11 to 21.  

The good news is that the project has already been successfully compiled with the new JDK. However, we have encountered some bugs that require extensive modifications across nearly all files in the project. As a result, we will need additional time to thoroughly test and ensure the stability of the system after these changes.  

We will keep you updated on our progress and provide a more detailed timeline once we have a clearer picture of the testing phase.  

Thank you for your understanding and patience.  

Best regards,
